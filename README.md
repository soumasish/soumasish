I am a Data Scientist/Engineer passionate about Distributed Computing. Scala is my language of choice when tinkering with distributed constructs.
I began my career in computing in 2008 as a Perl developer. In 2014, I moved to the United States to pursue graduate studies at the University at Buffalo. Since then, I have worked at companies like Amazon, LinkedIn, and Yahoo. I presently live in San Francisco.
