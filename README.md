I am a Software/Data Engineer and Architect passionate about Distributed Computing, Databases Internals, Language Internals, and Advanced Algorithms. I am currently working on the Let's Build series of courses on Youtube where I build a light clone of some of the popular distributed compute/storage frameworks to teach the internals of these systems.

I'm based out of San Francisco and have worked at companies like Amazon, LinkedIn and Yahoo. My journey in computing began in 2008 as a Perl developer. Between 2008 and 2014, I worked as an application developer in Europe and Middle East. In 2014, I moved to the US to attend grad school at the University at Buffalo. In 2016, after completing my MS in Computer Science, I moved to San Francisco Bay Area and have since been based out of here.
