I am a Software/Data Engineer and Architect passionate about Distributed Computing, Databases Internals, Language Internals, and Advanced Algorithms. I often build clones of popular distributed compute/storage frameworks to learn the internals of these systems.

In 2008, I began my career as a Perl developer. For the next six years, I worked as an application developer in Europe and the Middle East. In 2014, I moved to the United States to pursue graduate studies at the University at Buffalo. After earning a master's degree in computer science in 2016, I relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area. Since then, I have worked at companies like Amazon, LinkedIn, and Yahoo, and have made San Francisco my base.
