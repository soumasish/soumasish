I'm a Data Scientist/Engineer fascinated by the intersection of distributed computing and statistical learning - particularly how techniques like federated learning and distributed stochastic gradient descent enable scalable machine learning across massive datasets. Scala is my language of choice when tinkering with distributed constructs. That said, I've written Python and R for simulations and POCs. 
I began my career in computing in 2008 as a Perl developer. In 2014, I moved to the United States. I have worked at companies like Amazon, LinkedIn, and Yahoo. I presently live in San Francisco.
